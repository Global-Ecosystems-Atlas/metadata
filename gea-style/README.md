# Global Ecosystems Atlas Style Guides

This folder houses tables documenting the GEA style guides:

*Palettes are provided to enable implementation of the GEA standard colour scheme
*Numeral schemes (an integer, "PixelValue") are presented for GET classes (useful for statistical modelling and representation as a raster dataset). The numeral schemed has been designed to allow minor the inclusion of any new classes that may occur due to future updates to the Global Ecosystem Typology.
