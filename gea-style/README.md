# Global Ecosystems Atlas Styles

This folder houses tables, lists and colour palettes that enable consistent representation of the Global Ecosystems Atlas:

#### Colour palettes

* Colour palettes are provided in list and tabular format to offer standard representation of Realms, Biomes and Ecosystem Functional Groups.
* Colours are represented as both hexcodes and RGB colour levels. 

### Numeral scheme for the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology

* The Global Ecosystem Atlas numeral scheme enables representation of the Global Ecosystems Typology as integers.
* The numeral schemed was designed to be able to accommodate changes in any future versions or updates of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology.
* Integers (column: "PixelValue") are essential for (i) supporting statistical models tasked with estimating the distribution of ecosystems, and (ii) representing the Global Ecosystem Typology as an 8-bit raster data in the Global Ecosystems Atlas Synthesis dataset.
