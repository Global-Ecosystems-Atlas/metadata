# Global Ecosystems Atlas Metadata

This folder houses a range of metadata relevant to compiling and presenting the Global Ecosystems Atlas, including:

#### Colour palettes

* Standardised colour palettes provided in list and tabular format to enable consistent graphical of Atlas classes (IUCN GET) across platforms.
* Palette values are represented as both Hex codes and RGB colour levels. 

#### Pixel values: 

* A standard numerical scheme ("PixelValue", integer) is presented for GET classes used in the Global Ecosystems Atlas.
* This variable is essential for:
      (i) supporting statistical models tasked with estimating the distribution of ecosystems
      (ii) representing the Global Ecosystem Typology as an 8-bit raster data in the Global Ecosystems Atlas Synthesis dataset. 
* The numeral scheme was designed to be able to accommodate changes in any future versions or updates of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology.

#### Change-log

* A .md document providing a log of each notable change of the Global Ecosystems Atlas data products or resources.
