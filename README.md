# Global Ecosystems Atlas Style Guides

This folder houses a range of metadata relevant to the Global Ecosystems Atlas, including:

•	Palettes: 
Standardised colour schemes are provided to enable a consistent graphical representation of Atlas classes (IUCN GET) across platforms
•	Pixel values: 
A standard numerical scheme is presented for GET classes (useful for statistical modelling and representation as a raster dataset). 
The numeral schemed has been designed to allow minor the inclusion of any new classes that may occur due to future updates to the Global Ecosystem Typology.
