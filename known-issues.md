# Global Ecosystems Atlas Known Issues

This document lists known issues with the Global Ecosystems Atlas data products. Known issues are primarily errors, limitations, or inaccuracies that are present in the atlas data products. Known issues listed here are typically outside of the remit of the Global Ecosystems Atlas science program and are overwhelmingly due to errors in source data, such as mapping or classification errors. Issues that are within the remit of the Global Ecosystems Atlas science program, such as software bugs or artefacts introduced in geospatial processing, are tracked using github issues in the respective repository or in the (Global Ecosystems Atlas feedback repository)[https://github.com/Global-Ecosystems-Atlas/feedback]. 

## Known Issues
* Braided rivers in New Zealand are mapped as tidal flats in some cases.
